# r2d2-chatbot
The goal of this project is to set up a Star Wastar-wars-like interface where you can feel like you are talking to R2D2 and hear his beeps and boops while simultaneously getting it 'translated" on screen. However, if you would prefer I do speech-to-speech, I can do that as well.

For the r2d2 noises, I was planning to use the 'playsound' library (link 1). For capturing audio, I intend to use the google 'speech recognition' library (link 2). Then, for the chatbot piece, I was going to use the OpenAI library (link 3).

If we want to have it talk back to us, we can use the elevenLabs API (link 4).
