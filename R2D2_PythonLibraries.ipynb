    "The OpenAI library is a Python library developed by OpenAI, which is the company that has developed AI models such as ChatGPT. Thus, it provides a code-based way to interact with a large language model (LLM) without using our personal hardware. However, I should note that this comes at a cost (a couple of cents per message). Therefore, in order to use this library with ChatGPT, you will need to load some money. You will also need to get an API key, a personal identifying string of text that allows you to access your account (and therefore your personal funds). While I do go in depth and mention the link in the tutorial detailing getting an API key below, you can also go to the link here for reference: <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview\">https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview</a> "
